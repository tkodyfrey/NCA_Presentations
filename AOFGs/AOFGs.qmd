# Project Scope

## Introduction

-   Project focuses on communication gaps in medical translation.
-   Translational research from development to clinical application.
-   Understanding stakeholders for improved translational efficacy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Context and Methodological Considerations

-   Bench-to-bedside approach in biomedical projects.
-   Challenges: projects' slow progression, critical communicative disconnect.
-   Research Questions: Identify communication breakdowns, values affecting projects, and propose instructional interventions.

## AOFGs

-   Recruited through university listservs and contacts.
-   Included 37 faculty, students, and staff.
-   Range of identification from clinical to preclinical.
-   3 FGs lasted 4 weeks each.
-   Participants expected to contribute 60 minutes per week.

# Results & Methodological Observations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Linear Conversational Sequence

-   Teams' non-linear structure: benefits and challenges.
-   Lower drop-out rate, flexibility, and participant reflection.

## Reflexive Discussion Moderation

-   Teams' precision, flexibility, and coordination for moderators.
-   Synthesizing responses and careful reflection.

## Nonverbal Cues and Immediacy

-   Compensating for lack of nonverbal cues in Teams.
-   Use of emojis, tagging, chronemics, and profiles.

## Supporting Information

-   Richness of data with additional supporting material.
-   Enhanced responses through links and external information.

## Technical Competence {.smaller}

-   Challenges and benefits of technical competence.
-   Varying participant familiarity and usability.

"The reason that my participation was so light was due to my lack of familiarity with Microsoft Teams. In addition, I cannot see how virtual meetings are effective. It would have been ideal if just one time the group could have met in person. I have much experience related to translational studies but did not find Teams to be an appropriate application in which to communicate my experiences and conclusions."

# Discussion & Reflection

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview {.smaller}

"Questions were designed to assess the knowledge transfer gaps that occur between these researchers as projects are moving across translational stages, including where **communication breaks down**, **how opposing beliefs inhibit projects from developing quickly**, and **how educational interventions might prepare both groups to navigate this process more efficiently in the future**."

Reflection focuses on Teams' unique influence in 3 areas:

-   Interaction
-   Interpretation
-   Data Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Interaction

-   Discontinuities in conversational flow cause challenges in recreating AOFG interactions.
-   What counts as insightful reading (i.e., functional noise).
-   Need for strategic planning to leverage platform affordances.
-   Encouragement for researchers to know platforms intimately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ongoing Interpretation

-   Non-linearity as an epistemological benefit.
-   Reflexivity and critical thinking during data collection.
-   Opportunities for ongoing reflection and qualitative checks.
-   Leveraging technological features for richer data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Management

-   Teams' advantage in text-based data.
-   Complications in data extrapolation for qualitative analysis.
-   Importance of timely data export and reconstruction.
-   Must take care to preserve conversational nuances (e.g., group composition).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

-   Mental roadmap for ensuring effectiveness in this space centers on capitalizing on the resources and affordances offered by the service.
-   Can function as an appropriate and valid tool for generating focus group-equivalent insights.
-   AOFGs add a viable option to the qualitative methodological toolkit.
